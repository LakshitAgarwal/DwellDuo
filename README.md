#Getting Started with DwellDuo
Welcome to DwellDuo! To get this project up and running on your local environment, follow the simple steps outlined below. These instructions assume you have a basic understanding of terminal or command line usage.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you're unsure whether you have them or need to install them, you can find the instructions on the official Node.js website.

Installation
Install Dependencies

Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the DwellDuo project. Once there, execute the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

npm install

This command reads the package.json file in your project directory and installs all the dependencies listed there. It might take a few minutes to complete, depending on your internet connection speed.

Starting the Application

After all the dependencies have been successfully installed, you're ready to start the application. Still in the root directory of your project, run the following command:

npm start

This command starts the development server and opens the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't automatically open, you can manually access it by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Enjoy DwellDuo!

That's it! You're now ready to explore and use DwellDuo. If you encounter any issues during the installation or have questions about the project, feel free to consult the project documentation or reach out to the development team.
